## 📌 Premises and Context Before You Start

Before you dive into this plan or think of copying it, here are a few things that matter even more than the reps and sets:

### 0. Adaptation and Variety Are Built In

I love to **change things up** — not just to avoid plateaus, but to make training more fun and complete.

Sometimes I go through phases where I train like a maniac on strength (high load, low reps), so I lower cardio intensity and switch to Zone 2 runs. Other times, I’m all about trail running, intervals, or pure hypertrophy.

I believe in *seasons*, not rigidity. That’s how I keep improving — and enjoying it.

---

### 1. There Are No Fixed Days (Life Happens)

This plan isn’t locked into “Monday = Chest”, “Tuesday = Legs” mode.

I follow a **sequence**, not a calendar.  
If I miss a day (rare, but it happens), I just continue where I left off.

**Life is complex. Flexibility is power.**

---

### 2. Energy Levels Aren’t Constant (And That’s Okay)

Some days you’re on fire.  
Other days you’re fried.

Sometimes I shift sessions around depending on energy, sleep, or recovery. If I feel something off — I listen, adjust, and keep going.

> Think Agile for training: iteration, feedback, and responsiveness.

---

### 3. I’m Not David Goggins (Nor Trying to Be)

I’m not an influencer.  
I’m not a Navy SEAL.  
I’m just someone who values consistency and curiosity.

I try to understand what my body tells me.  
Some days I rest. Some weekends I skip training and hang out with friends. That’s part of the plan too.

No guilt. Just flow.

### 4. Don’t Do This Alone at Home Without Progression

The worst thing you can do is copy this plan without context or ramp-up.

🏁 **Start small.**  
⬆️ **Increase progressively.**  
🧠 **Learn your own signals.**


⚠️ Use this plan as inspiration, not gospel.  
**Listen to your body. And make it fun.**
